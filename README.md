# Shiny-App
This is about explore the House Price in the Boston Market. You can see them in action on 
https://min68.shinyapps.io/newtest/

To run the case locally, you can install the shiny package in R, and download this repository, and run it.

There are ui.r , server.r , house dataset and PPT. When you dowload ui. r and server.r, you can run either one then get web shiny app, then use the house dataset to check the situation. 

Good Luck!
